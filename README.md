# Create a Random Password Generator UsingÂ Python

The standard password requirements I have typically seen are:
1. At least one upper case letter
2. At least one lower case letter
3. At least one symbol
4. At least one number
5. Password length requirements vary from app to app but there typically is a min and max number of characters needed.


## Installation

Follow the instructions on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install the latest version of Python on your OS.
